## Setting up fullscreen on Android

Step 1:

Go to your ```android\app\src\main\java\your\package\directory``` folder where you can find ```MainActivity.java```. Copy the java files from the repo's  ```android\app\src\main\java``` folder and paste them there. Open those files in any editor(Android Studio recommended) and change the package names according to your project. After that, go to your ```MainApplication.java``` file 
and under the ```new MainReactPackage()```, copy and paste this: ```new BridgePackage()``` and it should look similar to the code below if you do not have other packages.
```
@Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
          new MainReactPackage(),
          new BridgePackage()
          );
     }
```
Step 2: 

Make a folder in your ```android\app\src\main\res``` directory and name it ```layout```, then copy the player_fullscreen.xml from the repo's ```android\app\src\main\res\layout``` directory and paste it into your directory and then go to your ```AndroidManifest.xml``` and add this before the ending application tag: 
            ```
            <activity android:name=".VideoActivity"
               android:screenOrientation="sensorLandscape"
               android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"
            />
            ```
            
           
If you want to remove the action bar, change your theme or change the theme for your activity from the manifest     

If you want to load from an obb file, add the following to your AndroidManifext.xml file.  Update the mainVersion and patchVersion to suit and remember to change for any updates:

<provider android:name="com.my.package.ZipFileContentProvider" android:authorities="com.my.package.provider">
    <meta-data android:name="mainVersion" android:value="73"></meta-data> 
    <meta-data android:name="patchVersion" android:value="0"></meta-data>
</provider>

Then pass the mainVer and expVer in as usual for react-native-video.

And then your fullscreen should be working and ready to go!
